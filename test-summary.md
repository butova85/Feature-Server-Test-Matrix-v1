# Test Summary — Feature Server Test Matrix v1

Date: 2026-02-12  
Author: Elena Butova

## Objective
Validate core feature service behavior across query, edit, permissions, and validation scenarios.

## Execution Snapshot
- Total test cases: 30
- Executed: 0 (starter matrix published)
- Passed: 0
- Failed: 0
- Blocked: 0
- Not Run: 30

## Initial Notes
This repository currently contains the v1 test matrix and structure.  
Execution evidence and findings will be added incrementally.

## Known Risks to Validate Next
1. Permission boundaries between Viewer and Editor roles
2. Invalid query/geometry handling consistency
3. Data integrity after chained updates/deletes

## Next Update Plan
- Execute first 10 high-priority cases
- Attach screenshots in `evidence/`
- Add first defect-style findings
