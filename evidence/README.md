# Evidence Folder

This folder stores supporting QA artifacts for `Feature-Server-Test-Matrix-v1`.

## What goes here
- Screenshots of test execution results
- Error messages and validation responses
- Before/after captures for edit operations
- Notes linked to specific test case IDs (FS-xxx)

## Naming Convention
Use clear, traceable file names:

`FS-<ID>_<short-description>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.<ext>`

Examples:
- `FS-004_invalid-field-error_2026-02-12.png`
- `FS-012_add-feature-success_2026-02-13.png`
- `FS-021_viewer-edit-blocked_2026-02-13.png`

## Evidence Quality Rules
- Keep captures readable and focused on the relevant behavior
- Include enough context to verify expected vs actual
- One key observation per file when possible
- Avoid duplicates unless showing sequence/timeline

## Privacy / Safety
Do **not** upload:
- credentials
- invitation links/tokens
- private org/user identifiers
- sensitive personal information

Use sanitized evidence only.
